            Laurence has been practicing immigration law in the international
            mobility sector since 2008, focusing on Canadian mobility and
            immigration law. She serves as the Head of Mobility at Exeo and
            co-chaired the Quebec Association of Immigration Lawyers (AQAADI) in
            2023, with a mandate centered on the economic sector and the
            mobility of foreign workers. Her co-chair mandate was renewed in
            June 2024.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laurence is also part of the liaison committees with IRCC, MIFI, and
            Service Canada. She assists startups, medium-sized businesses, and
            multinationals in their Canadian expansion; she also helps Canadian
            companies bring international workforce and talent to Canada.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laurence has led and authored legal reports to the Quebec and
            Canadian governments on behalf of AQAADI concerning temporary and
            permanent economic immigration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before joining Exeo, Laurence worked for three law firms
            specializing in immigration. She also previously worked for the
            Canadian federal government in the immigration and customs agency
            from 2002 to 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            With 20 years of experience in immigration, combining both public
            and private sectors, Laurence brings a wealth of expertise to her
            role.
